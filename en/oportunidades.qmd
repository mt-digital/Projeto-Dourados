# Student Opportunities

**Community connection and advanced research with real public-health impact**

Projeto Dourados offers opportunities for motivated students to contribute to
an interdisciplinary research and outreach initiative at the intersection of
social science, epidemiology, Indigenous public health, and international
collaboration between Brazil and the United States.

Student involvement may include research support, documentation and storytelling,
or technical development, depending on individual interests and background.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes

**Learn by doing. Contribute meaningfully.**


### For All Students

Participants will:

- Learn about Indigenous public health in Brazil, with a focus on the Dourados
  Indigenous Reserve.
- Gain exposure to epidemiology, social science, interdisciplinary, and
  international research.
- Develop skills in communicating complex research topics clearly to broad
  audiences.


### Documentation, Storytelling, and Outreach

Students interested in writing, communication, or community-facing work may:

- Learn about Indigenous languages spoken in the Reserve, including Guaraní and
  Terena.
- Study the history of the Dourados Indigenous Reserve and Brazil’s Indigenous
  reserve system.
- Publicize stories and findings on social media, in written pieces, and in
  documentary videos in the four Project languages: Guarani and Terena in
  addition to Portuguese and English. 
- Compare Indigenous public-health contexts across Brazilian states, including:
  - **Mato Grosso do Sul**, where the city of Dourados and the Reserve are
    immediate neighbors,
  - **Amazonas**, where Indigenous communities are geographically dispersed and
    often distant from urban centers, and
  - **Bahia**, where Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations are more socially
    integrated.

These comparisons help situate Dourados within a broader national context and
highlight how social structure shapes public-health challenges.

### Social Science and Epidemiology–Based Tool Development

Students with interests in data, modeling, or computation may:

- Learn R programming for data analysis and modeling.
- Contribute to websites and data dashboards built with Quarto.
- Learn how mathematical models are used to describe infectious-disease
  outbreaks.
- Apply Bayesian statistical methods to study how social and epidemiological
  factors influence disease spread, including:
  - village of residence,
  - Indigenous ethnicity,
  - and circulating COVID-19 variants.
