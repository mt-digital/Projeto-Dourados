# Research to Improve Indigenous Health

Indigenous peoples have suffered more from epidemic diseases and precarious
health conditions than groups—COVID-19 was no exception [@Simionatto2020].  Our
group came together following an article by Albuquerque, Rezende, Simionatto,
with others, that tracked different SARS-CoV-2 variants as they spread through
the Dourados Indigenous Reserve [@AlbuquerqueRezende2023].

This research can first help residents of the Dourados Indigenous Reserve
prepare for future pandemics by providing a tool to copmutationally evaluate
intervention strategies through simulation. Public health planners can use the
result of simulated intervention strategies to select and implement that best
one that most efficiently promotes health, saves lives, and conserves public
health resources in case of follow-on emergencies.  The lessons we learn will
help prepare for and prevent the spread of infectious diseases in other
Indigenous communities in Brazil and around the world.



### The Dourados Indigenous Reserve

- The Dourados Indigenous Reserve is home to about 18,000 residents with a
  variety of ethnicities, living in two distinct villages: Bororó and Jaguapiru.
  Jaguapiru is the larger, with about twice the population of Bororó.
- Two ethnic groups have the largest population size on the Reserve: Guarani
  Kaiowa and Terena.

Simonelli, and Matt Turner. The Reserve's hospital has both a Christian chapel
and an outdoor ceremonial structure with a fire pit for Indigenous spiritual
practices (b).  Public health stations in the interior of the Reserve provide
essential primary care for residents of the Dourados Reserve (c,d—see map below
for the location of these).  Independent storefronts like the *Mercearia
Conquista* (mer-say-ah-RI-ah con-QUIS-ta)—or, "the Cornerstore that
Persevered"—can be found throughout the Dourados Reserve (e). Click image to

## How Social Structure Shaped COVID-19 in the Reserve



![**Time series of COVID-19 spread through the Dourados Indigenous Reserve,**
with significant events highlighted. The first B.1.1 variant cases were
introduced by the Guarani ethnicity (1), followed about one month later by a
rapid rise in cases in Jaguapiru among the Terena ethnicity (2); several months
later a rapid rise in Bororó was caused by a rapid rise among Guarani (3). Zeta
was introduced at the end of 2020 (4), with a rapid rise around the holiday
season especially in Jaguapiru among Guarani (5); later in February cases rose
in Bororó among the Terena (6).](images/clipboard-2719146699.png){width="800"}

### Unanswered Questions



## Current Research Project

Turner is leading the effort to formalize the hypotheses above into an
epidemiology simulation model that we will use statistics and computer models to
answer the following questions:

1. Which social groupings (village, ethnicity, village $\cross$ ethnicity)
   matter most, given the observations?
2. Was travel to the city a significant factor for importing different variants?
3. Which social intervention could have most efficiently limited disease spread 

analysis to answer some of the new questions raised by Rezende, Albuquerque, and
Simionatto's (2023) work. Specifically, he is developing a mathematical
statistical model to understand **which social groupings are actually relevant
for eipdemiological dynamics?** This is parameterizes the model we use to answer
our second research question: given limited resources for encouraging quarantine
behaviors during an outbreak, **how could limited resources best be spent to
encourage quarantine behaviors during an outbreak?**

more efficient and equitable outcomes, even if that means unequitable allocation
of resources (b).](images/clipboard-721006767.png){width=750 .lightbox}
