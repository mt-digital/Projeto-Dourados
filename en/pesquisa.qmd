# Research to Improve Indigenous Health

Indigenous peoples have suffered more from epidemic diseases and precarious health conditions than any other population group.

Our group of international researchers came together following an article by Brazilian researchers Laís Albuquerque and Professor Simone Simionatto of the Federal University of Grande Dourados (UFGD), and Dr. Izabela de Rezende of *Stanford University* in the United States.

This research will first help residents of the Dourados Indigenous Reserve. The lessons we learn will help prepare for and prevent the spread of infectious diseases in other Indigenous communities in Brazil and around the world.

### A Reserva

O hospital tem uma capela cristã ao lado de uma estrutura cerimonial indígena com fogueira ritual (b).” Public health stations provide essential primary care for residents of the Dourados Reserve (c,d). Independent storefronts like the *Mercearia Conquista—*or, "the Cornerstore that Persevered"—can be found throughout the Dourados Reserve (e).](/imagens/clipboard-1663480214.png){width="750"}

## How Social Structure Shaped COVID-19 in the Reserve

![**Time series of COVID-19 spread through the Dourados Indigenous Reserve,** with significant events highlighted. The first B.1.1 variant cases were introduced by the Guarani ethnicity (1), followed about one month later by a rapid rise in cases in Jaguapiru among the Terena ethnicity (2); several months later a rapid rise in Bororó was caused by a rapid rise among Guarani (3). Zeta was introduced at the end of 2020 (4), with a rapid rise around the holiday season especially in Jaguapiru among Guarani (5); later in February cases rose in Bororó among the Terena (6).](images/clipboard-2719146699.png){width="800"}

## Unanswered Questions

**Like all good science, Rezende, Albuquerque, and Simionatto's observations of how social structure shaped COVID-19 in the Reserve raised a new set of questions about** hat Rezende, Albuquerque and Simionatto found raised new.

It is necessary to come into contact with other people in order to contract a disease such as COVID-19, or other illnesses that spread through respiration in close social interaction. Others may be transmitted through blood or sexual contact.

Therefore, if we want to prepare for the next pandemic — or, even better, *prevent* it — we need to better understand how people organize themselves and interact socially.

On the other hand, social scientists know that there are opportunities to apply advanced theories from multiple disciplines within the social sciences. However, it is difficult to learn enough epidemiology to contribute directly to improvements in Indigenous health — or, similarly, to other problems and contexts beyond the social sciences.

## Ongoing Research Project

Turner is working to formalize the above analysis to answer some of the new questions raised by Rezende, Albuquerque, and Simionatto's (2024) work. Specifically, he is developing a mathematical statistical model to understand **which social groupings are actually relevant for eipdemiological dynamics?** This is parameterizes the model we use to answer our second research question: given limited resources for encouraging quarantine behaviors during an outbreak, **how could limited resources best be spent to encourage quarantine behaviors during an outbreak?**
