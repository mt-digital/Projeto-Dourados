# Research to Improve Indigenous Health

Indigenous peoples have suffered more from epidemic diseases and precarious
health conditions than groups—COVID-19 was no exception [@Simionatto2020].  Our
group came together following an article by Albuquerque, Rezende, Simionatto,
with others, that tracked different SARS-CoV-2 variants as they spread through
the Dourados Indigenous Reserve [@AlbuquerqueRezende2023].

This research can first help residents of the Dourados Indigenous Reserve
prepare for future pandemics by providing a tool to copmutationally evaluate
intervention strategies through simulation. Public health planners can use the
result of simulated intervention strategies to select and implement that best
one that most efficiently promotes health, saves lives, and conserves public
health resources in case of follow-on emergencies.  The lessons we learn will
help prepare for and prevent the spread of infectious diseases in other
Indigenous communities in Brazil and around the world.



### The Dourados Indigenous Reserve

- More about where the Reserve is, referring to the big Brazil map. 
- History of Indigenous peoples, the Reserva system, planting some seeds for
  explaining how Terena + Guarani Kaiowa and other Guarani came to live 
  in this particular Reserve.

- The Dourados Indigenous Reserve is home to about 18,000 residents with a
  variety of ethnicities, living in two distinct villages: Bororó and Jaguapiru.
  Jaguapiru is the larger, with about twice the population of Bororó.
- Two ethnic groups have the largest population size on the Reserve: Guarani
  Kaiowa and Terena.

chapel and an outdoor ceremonial structure with a fire pit for Indigenous
spiritual practices (b). 
Public health stations in the interior of the Reserve 
provide essential primary care for residents
of the Dourados Reserve (c,d—see map below for the location of these). 
Independent storefronts like the *Mercearia
Conquista* (mer-say-ah-RI-ah con-QUIS-ta)—or, "the Cornerstore that Persevered"—can be found throughout the

## How Social Structure Shaped COVID-19 in the Reserve


Albuquerque, Rezenende, Simionatto, and their co-authors created a system for
genomic sequencing and monitoring to track the spread of COVID-19 variants in
the Reserve during the pandemic. Differences in arrival timing could determine
which public health response would be most effective.  This allowed the
authors to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 variants arrived in the Reserve when they
arrived elsewhere in Brazil. However some observed transmission patters seem
to be uniquely shaped by the social, economic, and geographic structure of the
Reserve.

In July, 2020, the first COVID cases (variant B.1.1) 
were detected both in the towns of Jaguapiru and Bororó. Apparently, however,
only Guarani Kaiowá ethnicity individuals were among the first infected (Time 1
in @fig-variants-timeseries). About a month later, a sharp increase
in cases was detected—but in this case, infections were detected almost
exclusively among ethnic Terena residents, and only in the Jaguapiru village
(Time 2 in @fig-variants-timeseries). Variant B.1.1 continued to spread 
in the Jaguapiru village over September and August, 2020, but infected
individuals were of a mix of Terena and Guarani ethnicities over these months.

The final surge in variant B.1.1 cases came...

![**Time series of COVID-19 spread through the Dourados Indigenous Reserve,**
with significant events highlighted. Variant B.1.1 was first detected in
the the Guarani ethnicity (1), followed about one month later by a rapid rise in
cases in Jaguapiru among the Terena ethnicity (2); several months later a rapid
rise in Bororó was caused by a rapid rise among Guarani (3). Zeta was introduced
at the end of 2020 (4), with a rapid rise around the holiday season especially
in Jaguapiru among Guarani (5); later in February cases rose in Bororó among the
Terena (6).](images/clipboard-2719146699.png){width="800" .lightbox

### Unanswered Questions

Perhaps Jaguapiru's proximity to the city drives infection rates there. If this
were true, then future pandemic preparedness plans might do well to focus
resources on Jaguapiru residents who travel to the city due to economic
necessity. 

No matter how SARS-CoV-2 entered the Reserve, the structure of social
interaction determines how it, or any other pathogen, spreads. But we do not
know exactly which formula for creating groups best represents the COVID-19
data. 


## Current Research Project

Turner is leading the effort to formalize the hypotheses above into an
epidemiology simulation and statistical model of COVID-19 transmission 
in the Reserve to plan public health interventions like incentivizing 
staying home so residents do not feel it to be economically necessary. 

We first use data gathered by Albuquerque, Rezende, and Simionatto
to _fit_ the simulation model using statistics. This means we figure out how our
computer model works by seeing which model configuration creates simulated data
that best matches epidemiological observations. 

Our model represents transmission of disease through travel between Reserve and
City, followed by the spread of disease, which is shaped by
interpersonal contact networks. See the sketch of this model in @fig-model where mobility and interpersonal contact
behaviors for different groups are represented by mathematical symbols—see figure caption for details. 

To figure out which version of this model most faithfully represents COVID-19 
in the Reserve. In other words, we must _infer_ the following:

1. Which social groupings (village, ethnicity, village$\times$ethnicity)
   result in models that best match observations?
2. Was travel to the city a significant factor for importing different variants?
3. Did reinfection play a significant role in the Zeta outbreak in the Reserve? 


![**Sketch of the mobility, social mixing, and interaction model for
epidemiological dynamics.** The symbols $c_{gg'}$ indicate how frequnetly
members from different groups $g$ and $g'$ interact—grouped by town residency or
ethnicity.  $\gamma_g$ indicates how frequenly each group travels to the city of
Dourados.](images/clipboard-2581785424.png){width=650 #fig-model .lightbox}

While understanding is nice, we plan to do all this so that we can more 
reliably prepare social interventions to stem the spread of disease once it 
starts. Once we infer how a faithful model works, we can put it to work 
planning interventions.

We use our method to infer which intervention strategy best limits the number of
cases. Different intervention strategies are defined by their expenditure to
achieve different social changes. In our model we represent social changes by
changes in the parameter values that define mobility and social contact
structure.

For example, say the government could spend money reduce the rate at which
people travel to the city for one, several, or all of the social groups. The
resources do not have to be spent evenly. One might imagine that since Jaguapiru
is closer to the Reserve, that perhaps more Jaguapiru residents regularly travel
to the city.


![**Sketches of model outcomes for the current project to plan a public health
intervention under limited resources.** Groups will benefit differently to a
quarantine public health intervention that targets all groups equally, and
assuming zero reinfections (a). Intervention strategies can be tuned to achieve
more efficient and equitable outcomes, even if that means unequitable allocation
of resources (b).](images/clipboard-721006767.png){width=750 #fig-results-sketch .lightbox}


## Long-term Vision

Efficiency is essential since resources are limited—we don't have the
resources or time to experiment in the real world. 

Statistical and simulation trials are of course useful because they help us
understand and predict real-world phenomena. However they serve another purpose
that is not so directly seen. Models help highlight gaps in our understanding,
that reveal where our efforts for additional basic anthropological research, 
for example, could be best spent.

We have a unique and powerful opportunity to advance public health for
Indigenous peoples. We plan to have a vibrant team of faculty and student researchers on the ground
in Dourados documenting the Reserve and the epidemiological work being done
there. This side of the project is essential to ground our development
of powerful computational tools for public health policy.
