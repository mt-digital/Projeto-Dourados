# Research to Improve Indigenous Health

Indigenous peoples have long faced disproportionate risks from epidemic diseases
and precarious health conditions. COVID-19 was no exception [@Simionatto2020].

Projeto Dourados continues our collaboration that started when
Albuquerque, Rezende, and Simionatto—together with other co-authors—tracked the
spread of different SARS-CoV-2 variants within the Dourados Indigenous Reserve
[@AlbuquerqueRezende2023].

Our current research builds on their work by using original data to explain how
social structure shaped transmission in the Reserve during COVID-19. Social
structure means who interacts with whom, and how often. Geography shapes social
structure: we interact more often with those nearby than far away. Cultural,
ethnic, and economic groupings also shape these patterns.

The goal of this research is to support residents of the Dourados Indigenous
Reserve in preparing for future pandemics. We develop computational tools that
allow different response strategies to be explored through simulation, making it
possible to anticipate trade-offs before crises arise. 

While grounded in the context of Dourados, we intend our work to be adaptable to 
improve preparedness and disease prevention in other Indigenous communities in
Brazil and beyond.


### The Dourados Indigenous Reserve

The Dourados Indigenous Reserve is located in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in
southwestern Brazil, adjacent to the city of Dourados (Figure 1). The Reserve lies
within a region shaped by long histories of Indigenous settlement, displacement,
and state-led reservation policies, which brought together multiple Indigenous
groups into a shared territory.

Today, the Reserve is home to approximately 18,000 residents living in two
distinct villages: Bororó and Jaguapiru. Jaguapiru is the larger of the two, with
roughly twice the population of Bororó. The population includes members of
multiple Indigenous groups, with Guarani Kaiowa and Terena comprising the largest
shares of residents [PLACEHOLDER: population by ethnicity, if needed].

The spatial organization of the Reserve reflects its proximity to the city of
Dourados while remaining socially and administratively distinct. Figure 1
situates the Reserve within Brazil and shows the relative locations of Bororó and
Jaguapiru, along with sites used for public health surveillance during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Daily life in the Reserve is supported by a mix of shared institutions and local
infrastructure (Figure 2). The Reserve’s hospital serves as a central hub for care
and includes both a Christian chapel and an outdoor ceremonial structure with a
fire pit used for Indigenous spiritual practices. Smaller public health stations
and independent storefronts provide essential services throughout the Reserve.

## How Social Structure Shaped COVID-19 in the Reserve

Albuquerque, Rezenende, Simionatto, and their co-authors created a system for
genomic sequencing and monitoring to track the spread of COVID-19 variants in
the Reserve during the pandemic. Differences in arrival timing could determine
which public health response would be most effective.  This allowed the
authors to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 variants arrived in the Reserve when they
arrived elsewhere in Brazil. However several observed transmission patters seem
to be uniquely shaped by the social, economic, and geographic structure of the
Reserve.

![**Time series of COVID-19 spread through the Dourados Indigenous Reserve,**
with significant events highlighted. Variant B.1.1 was first detected in
the the Guarani ethnicity (1), followed about one month later by a rapid rise in
cases in Jaguapiru among the Terena ethnicity (2); several months later a rapid
rise in Bororó was caused by a rapid rise among Guarani (3). Zeta was introduced
at the end of 2020 (4), with a rapid rise around the holiday season especially
in Jaguapiru among Guarani (5); later in February cases rose in Bororó among the
Terena (6).](images/clipboard-2719146699.png){width="800" .lightbox
#fig-variants-timeseries}

In July, 2020, the first COVID cases (variant B.1.1) 
were detected both in the towns of Jaguapiru and Bororó. Apparently, however,
only Guarani Kaiowá ethnicity individuals were among the first infected (Time 1
in @fig-variants-timeseries). About a month later, a sharp increase
in cases was detected—but in this case, infections were detected almost
exclusively among ethnic Terena residents, and only in the Jaguapiru village
(Time 2 in @fig-variants-timeseries). Variant B.1.1 continued to spread 
in the Jaguapiru village over September and August, 2020, but infected
individuals were of a mix of Terena and Guarani ethnicities over these months.

The final surge in variant B.1.1 cases occurred several months later and was
concentrated primarily in the Bororó village (Time 3 in
@fig-variants-timeseries). Unlike earlier phases of spread, this increase was
driven largely by infections among Guarani individuals. By this point, the
variant had already circulated within Jaguapiru across multiple ethnic groups,
suggesting that the later rise in Bororó reflected delayed transmission along
interaction pathways linking the two villages rather than a new introduction.

A similar pattern was observed following the introduction of the Zeta (P.2)
variant at the end of 2020. Zeta cases rose rapidly in Jaguapiru around the
holiday season, particularly among Guarani individuals (Times 4–5 in
@fig-variants-timeseries), before appearing later in Bororó, where infections
were again concentrated among Terena residents (Time 6). Because many
individuals had already been infected during earlier waves, this surge is
consistent with a combination of new infections and reinfections, rather than
simple spread through a fully susceptible population.

Across both variants, transmission followed a repeated sequence: early increases
within specific ethnic groups and villages, followed by delayed spread to other
groups and locations. The recurrence of this pattern under different variants,
and under conditions where prior infection was common, suggests that socially
structured interaction pathways continued to shape transmission even in the
presence of partial immunity.

Taken together, these patterns indicate that COVID-19 transmission within the
Reserve was shaped not only by when variants arrived, but by how social
interactions were structured across ethnic and village boundaries. Rather than
diffusing uniformly through the population, infections appear to have moved along
socially patterned pathways, reflecting differences in contact frequency and
mixing across groups. These dynamics motivate a closer examination of social
structure as a key driver of disease spread within the Reserve.


### Unanswered Questions

The patterns described above suggest that social structure played a central role
in shaping COVID-19 transmission within the Reserve. However, several key
questions remain unresolved.

Perhaps Jaguapiru’s proximity to the city drove higher infection rates there. If
this were true, future pandemic preparedness plans might do well to focus
resources on Jaguapiru residents who travel to the city due to economic
necessity.

More generally, no matter how SARS-CoV-2 entered the Reserve, the structure of
social interaction determines how it—and any other pathogen—spreads. What
remains unclear is which way of defining social groups best represents the
observed COVID-19 dynamics.


## Current Research Project

Turner is leading an effort to formalize the hypotheses above into an
epidemiological simulation and statistical model of COVID-19 transmission in the
Reserve. The goal is to support public health planning for interventions such as
incentivizing staying home, so that residents do not feel economically compelled
to travel during outbreaks.

We begin by using data gathered by Albuquerque, Rezende, and Simionatto to *fit*
the simulation model using statistical inference. In practice, this means
identifying which model configurations generate simulated data that most closely
match observed epidemiological patterns.

The model represents disease transmission through travel between the Reserve and
the city of Dourados, followed by local spread shaped by interpersonal contact
networks. A schematic overview of this structure is shown in @fig-model, where
mobility and contact behaviors for different social groups are represented
symbolically.

To determine which version of this model most faithfully represents COVID-19 in
the Reserve, we infer the following:

1. Which social groupings (village, ethnicity, or village × ethnicity) produce
   models that best match the observed data?
2. Was travel to the city a significant factor in importing different variants?
3. Did reinfection play a significant role in the Zeta outbreak in the Reserve?

$\gamma_g$ indicates how frequently each group travels to the city of Dourados.](images/clipboard-2581785424.png){width=650 #fig-model .lightbox}

While understanding these dynamics is valuable in its own right, our primary aim
is to use this knowledge to prepare effective social interventions before
outbreaks escalate. Once a faithful model has been inferred, it can be put to
work evaluating intervention strategies.

We use the model to infer which intervention strategies most effectively limit
the number of cases under constrained resources. Different strategies correspond
to different expenditures aimed at producing specific social changes. In the
model, these changes are represented as adjustments to parameters governing
mobility and social contact structure.

For example, public funds might be used to reduce travel to the city for one,
several, or all social groups. Resources need not be allocated evenly. Given
Jaguapiru’s proximity to the city, one might plausibly expect residents of
Jaguapiru to travel more frequently than those in Bororó.

## Long-term Vision

Efficiency is essential: resources are limited, and we do not have the time or
capacity to experiment freely in the real world.

Statistical and simulation studies are valuable not only because they help us
understand and predict real-world phenomena, but also because they highlight gaps
in our knowledge. These gaps can point to where additional basic research—such as
anthropological or ethnographic work—would be most valuable.

We see a unique opportunity to advance public health for Indigenous communities.
Our long-term vision includes building a vibrant team of faculty and student
researchers working on the ground in Dourados, documenting the Reserve and the
public health efforts taking place there. This on-the-ground engagement is
essential for grounding the development of effective computational tools for
public health policy.
