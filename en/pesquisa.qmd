# Research to Improve Indigenous Health

Indigenous peoples have suffered more from epidemic diseases and precarious
health conditions than groups—COVID-19 was no exception [@Simionatto2020]. 
Our group came together following an article by Albuquerque, Rezende,
Simionatto, with others, that tracked different SARS-CoV-2 variants as they
spread through the Dourados Indigenous Reserve [@AlbuquerqueRezende2023].

This research can first help residents of the Dourados Indigenous
Reserve prepare for future pandemics by providing a tool to copmutationally
evaluate intervention strategies through simulation. Public health planners can
use the result of simulated intervention strategies to select and implement 
that best one that most efficiently promotes health, saves lives, and conserves
public health resources in case of follow-on emergencies.  The lessons we learn
will help prepare for and prevent the spread of infectious diseases in other
Indigenous communities in Brazil and around the world.



### The Dourados Indigenous Reserve

- The Dourados Indigenous Reserve is home to about 18,000 residents with a
  variety of ethnicities, living in two distinct villages: Bororó and Jaguapiru. 
  Jaguapiru is the larger, with about twice the population of Bororó.
- Two ethnic groups have the largest population size on the Reserve: Guarani
  Kaiowa and Terena.

chapel and an outdoor ceremonial structure with a fire pit for Indigenous
spiritual practices (b). 
Public health stations in the interior of the Reserve 
provide essential primary care for residents
of the Dourados Reserve (c,d—see map below for the location of these).

## How Social Structure Shaped COVID-19 in the Reserve


Albuquerque, Rezenende, Simionatto, and their co-authors created a system for
genomic sequencing and monitoring to track the spread of COVID-19 variants in
the Reserve during the pandemic. Differences in arrival timing could determine
which public health response would be most effective.  This allowed the
authors to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 variants arrived in the Reserve when they
arrived elsewhere in Brazil. However some observed transmission patters seem
to be uniquely shaped by the social, economic, and geographic structure of the
Reserve.

In July, 2020, the first COVID cases (variant B.1.1) 
were detected both in the towns of Jaguapiru and Bororó. Apparently, however,
only Guarani Kaiowá ethnicity individuals were among the first infected (Time 1
in @fig-variants-timeseries).  About a month later, a sharp increase
in cases was detected—but in this case, infections were detected almost
exclusively among ethnic Terena residents, and only in the Jaguapiru village
(Time 2 in @fig-variants-timeseries). Variant B.1.1 continued to spread 
in the Jaguapiru village over September and August, 2020, but infected
individuals were of a mix of Terena and Guarani ethnicities over these months.

The final surge in cases came

with significant events highlighted. Variant B.1.1 was first detected in
the the Guarani ethnicity (1), followed about one month later by a rapid rise in
cases in Jaguapiru among the Terena ethnicity (2); several months later a rapid
rise in Bororó was caused by a rapid rise among Guarani (3). Zeta was introduced
at the end of 2020 (4), with a rapid rise around the holiday season especially
in Jaguapiru among Guarani (5); later in February cases rose in Bororó among the
Terena (6).](images/clipboard-2719146699.png){width="800" .lightbox

### Unanswered Questions

## Current Research Project

Turner is leading the effort to formalize the hypotheses above into an
epidemiology simulation model that we will use statistics and computer models
to answer the following questions:

Specifically, he is developing a mathematical statistical model to understand **which social groupings are actually relevant for eipdemiological dynamics?** This is parameterizes the model we use to answer our second research question: given limited resources for encouraging quarantine behaviors during an outbreak, **how could limited resources best be spent to encourage quarantine behaviors during an outbreak?**
