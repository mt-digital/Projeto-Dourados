# A Cultural Exchange Program {#index-title .unnumbered}

::: {#index-subtitle}
[**To Promote Indigenous Health in the Western Hemisphere**]{.smallcaps}
:::


_Projeto_ (Project) _Dourados_—pronounced _doe-RAH-doose_, meaning _golden_—began when researchers from South
and North of the Equator met at the Universidade Federal de Grande Dourados
(UFGD), Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. 

We saw the need for new efforts to bring together epidemiologists and social scientists, and to bring together researchers from
Brazil and the United States to learn from one another and strengthen scientific
ties as the two largest democracies in the Americas with rich Indigenous
cultural heritage. 

In both countries, unfortunately, Indigenous peoples have
historically suffered more acutely from disease than colonial
arrivals for a variety of reasons—and continue to suffer more, as we saw during
the COVID-19 pandemic.

In response to this need, we have deveoped a new
educational and research exchange program to connect South and North American
scientists, starting with our two institutions, UFGD and Stanford University.

The project aims to showcase and build on the public health 
partnerships and research deveoped by Prof. Simone Simionatto, her students, and
colleagues at UFSC and beyond that has advanced the science and practice of 
public health in her community: the city of Dourados and the 
neighboring Dourados Indigenous Reserve. 

**We are currently recruiting students at UFGD to work remotely with researchers in the
United States**, possibly with visits from researchers from Stanford University
during the upcoming 2026 academic year. 

**Some participants will help tell the
story of Prof. Simionatto's work**—including adding Guaraní- and Terena-language
translations of this website and other Projeto documentary and research
materials.

**Other participants
will advance the interdisciplinary science of how social behavior affects
disease spread for improved pandemic preparedness** and public health 
in the context of the Dourados Reserve and the city of Dourados.


### More on Project Goals

We have two primary short-term goals for project outputs over the next few 
years: 

1. **Document the public health situation at the Dourados Reserve and how Prof.
   Simionatto puts science to use for public health there.** During the COVID-19
   pandemic, Prof. Simionatto tracked the spread of different . In ongoing work,
   she coordinates with a team of hospital epidemiologists 
   monitoring and researching the origins and trajectories of the latest outbreaks
   so they can act fast if the next COVID-19—or worse—emerges.
2. **Develop computational decision-support tools for public health interventions for
   pandemic preparedness** that explicitly model the effect that various 
   socio-economic factors have on the spread of disease.

### How to Contribute

We have opportunities for students in epidemiology, social sciences, political science, international relations, and related fields. We are looking for students interested in contributing to the project during the upcoming academic year.

If you have a research idea that aligns with the goals of the project, are interested in working with us, or would simply like more information, please contact us at:

#### Timeline and Deliverables

- **Q1 2026:** Recruit UFGD student participants, introductions, begin projects.
- **Q2 2026:** First drafts of journal articles, premiere some documentary short
  films about the Reserve and our research (3-minute videos or less produced
  with phone video cameras), publish first translations and other web content.
- **Q3 2026:** 
- **Q4 2026:**
- **2027 and beyond:**



### Our Team



### Foundational Support

Founding Projeto Dourados was made possible by the support of Mrs. Jill
Freidenrich, whose funding provided Rezende and Turner with fellowships for
salary support and research funds at the Pandemic Preparedness Hub at Stanford
Medicine. This enabled Rezende to initiate her project with Simionatto, with
Turner joining after Rezende updated Mrs. Freidenrich and Pandemic Preparedness Hub colleagues during one of our regular meetings—it was clear this was the perfect project for working to advance the practical use of social science for epidemiology.
