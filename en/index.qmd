# A Cultural Exchange Program {#index-title .unnumbered}

::: {#index-subtitle}
[**To Promote Indigenous Health in the Western Hemisphere**]{.smallcaps}
:::

_Projeto_ (Project) _Dourados_—pronounced _doe-RAH-doose_, meaning _golden_—began when
researchers from South and North America met at the Universidade Federal de
Grande Dourados (UFGD), Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.

We recognized the need for new efforts to bring together epidemiologists and
social scientists, and to connect researchers from Brazil and the United States,
so they could learn from one another and strengthen scientific ties between the
two largest democracies in the Americas—both with rich Indigenous cultural
heritage.

In both countries, Indigenous peoples have historically suffered more acutely
from disease than colonial arrivals for a variety of reasons—and continue to do
so, as the COVID-19 pandemic made clear.

In response, we developed a new educational and research exchange program to
connect South and North American scientists, beginning with our two institutions,
UFGD and Stanford University.

### Our Project

The project builds on public health partnerships and research led by Prof.
Simone Simionatto, her students, and colleagues at UFSC and beyond, which have
advanced both the science and practice of public health in her community: the
city of Dourados and the neighboring Dourados Indigenous Reserve.

**We are currently recruiting UFGD students to work remotely with researchers in
the United States**, with the possibility of visits from Stanford University
researchers during the 2026 academic year.

**One group of participants will help document and communicate Prof.
Simionatto’s work**, including producing Guaraní- and Terena-language translations
of this website and other Projeto Dourados materials.

**Another group will advance interdisciplinary research on how social behavior
shapes disease spread**, contributing to improved pandemic preparedness and
public health in Dourados and the surrounding Indigenous Reserve.

### More on Project Goals

We have two primary short-term goals for project outputs over the next few years:

1. **Document public health conditions in the Dourados Indigenous Reserve and how
   science is put into practice locally.** During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prof.
   Simionatto tracked the spread of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. In ongoing
   work, she coordinates with hospital epidemiologists monitoring the origins
   and trajectories of new outbreaks to enable rapid response if the next
   COVID-19—or worse—emerges.

2. **Develop computational decision-support tools for pandemic preparedness**
   that explicitly model how social and economic factors influence disease
   spread.

### How to Contribute

We welcome students from epidemiology, social sciences, political science,
international relations, and related fields who are interested in contributing
during the upcoming academic year.

#### Timeline and Deliverables

- **Q1 2026:** Recruit UFGD student participants; introductions; begin projects.
- **Q2 2026:** First journal article drafts; release short documentary films
  (≤3-minute videos produced with mobile phones); publish initial translations
  and web content.
- **Q3 2026:** Revise and submit manuscripts; expand documentary and outreach
  materials; continue collaboration.
- **Q4 2026:** Synthesize project outputs; assess next phases of collaboration
  and funding.
- **2027 and beyond:** Sustain and expand the exchange program as opportunities
  allow.

### Foundational Support

Projeto Dourados was made possible through the support of Mrs. Jill Freidenrich,
whose funding provided fellowships and research support for Rezende and Turner at
the Pandemic Preparedness Hub at Stanford Medicine. This support enabled Rezende
to initiate collaboration with Simionatto, with Turner joining soon after. It
quickly became clear that this project was a strong fit for advancing the
practical use of social science in epidemiology.
