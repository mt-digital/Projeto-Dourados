    "text": "Indigenous peoples have long faced disproportionate risks from epidemic diseases and precarious health conditions. COVID-19 was no exception (Simionatto, Barbosa, and Marchioro 2020).\nProjeto Dourados continues our collaboration that started when Albuquerque, Rezende, and Simionatto—together with other co-authors—tracked the spread of different SARS-CoV-2 variants within the Dourados Indigenous Reserve (Oliveira et al. 2023).\nOur current research builds on their work by using original data to explain how social structure shaped transmission in the Reserve during COVID-19. Social structure means who interacts with whom, and how often. Geography shapes social structure: we interact more often with those nearby than far away. Cultural, ethnic, and economic groupings also shape these patterns.\nThe goal of this research is to support residents of the Dourados Indigenous Reserve in preparing for future pandemics. We develop computational tools that allow different response strategies to be explored through simulation, making it possible to anticipate trade-offs before crises arise.\nWhile grounded in the context of Dourados, we intend our work to be adaptable to improve preparedness and disease prevention in other Indigenous communities in Brazil and beyond.\n\n\nThe Dourados Indigenous Reserve is located in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in southwestern Brazil, adjacent to the city of Dourados (Figure 1). The Reserve lies within a region shaped by long histories of Indigenous settlement, displacement, and state-led reservation policies, which brought together multiple Indigenous groups into a shared territory.\nToday, the Reserve is home to approximately 18,000 residents living in two villages: Bororó and Jaguapiru. Jaguapiru is the larger of the two, with roughly twice the population of Bororó. The population includes members of multiple Indigenous groups, with Guarani Kaiowa and Terena comprising the largest shares of residents.\nThe spatial organization of the Reserve reflects its proximity to the city of Dourados while remaining socially and administratively distinct. Figure 1 situates the Reserve within Brazil and shows the relative locations of Bororó and Jaguapiru, along with sites used for public health surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Location and geography of the Dourados Indigenous Reserve. The Reserve and its two villages are shown in relation to the city of Dourados and their position within Brazil.\n\n\n\nDaily life in the Reserve is supported by a mix of shared institutions and local infrastructure (Figure 2). The Reserve’s hospital serves as a central hub for care and includes both a Christian chapel and an outdoor ceremonial structure with a fire pit used for Indigenous spiritual practices. Smaller public health stations and independent storefronts provide essential services throughout the Reserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Everyday institutions in the Dourados Indigenous Reserve. Scenes from the Reserve include the hospital, public health stations, and local independent storefronts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbuquerque, Rezenende, Simionatto, and their co-authors created a system for genomic sequencing and monitoring to track the spread of COVID-19 variants in the Reserve during the pandemic. Differences in arrival timing could determine which public health response would be most effective. This allowed the authors to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 variants arrived in the Reserve when they arrived elsewhere in Brazil. However several observed transmission patters seem to be uniquely shaped by the social, economic, and geographic structure of the Reserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Time series of COVID-19 spread through the Dourados Indigenous Reserve, with significant events highlighted. Variant B.1.1 was first detected in the the Guarani ethnicity (1), followed about one month later by a rapid rise in cases in Jaguapiru among the Terena ethnicity (2); several months later a rapid rise in Bororó was caused by a rapid rise among Guarani (3). Zeta was introduced at the end of 2020 (4), with a rapid rise around the holiday season especially in Jaguapiru among Guarani (5); later in February cases rose in Bororó among the Terena (6).\n\n\n\nIn July, 2020, the first COVID cases (variant B.1.1) were detected both in the towns of Jaguapiru and Bororó. Apparently, however, only Guarani Kaiowá ethnicity individuals were among the first infected (Time 1 in Figure 3). About a month later, a sharp increase in cases was detected—but in this case, infections were detected almost exclusively among ethnic Terena residents, and only in the Jaguapiru village (Time 2 in Figure 3). Variant B.1.1 continued to spread in the Jaguapiru village over September and August, 2020, but infected individuals were of a mix of Terena and Guarani ethnicities over these months.\nThe final surge in variant B.1.1 cases occurred several months later and was concentrated primarily in the Bororó village (Time 3 in Figure 3). Unlike earlier phases of spread, this increase was driven largely by infections among Guarani individuals. By this point, the variant had already circulated within Jaguapiru across multiple ethnic groups, suggesting that the later rise in Bororó reflected delayed transmission along interaction pathways linking the two villages rather than a new introduction.\nA similar pattern was observed following the introduction of the Zeta (P.2) variant at the end of 2020. Zeta cases rose rapidly in Jaguapiru around the holiday season, particularly among Guarani individuals (Times 4–5 in Figure 3), before appearing later in Bororó, where infections were again concentrated among Terena residents (Time 6). Because many individuals had already been infected during earlier waves, this surge is consistent with a combination of new infections and reinfections, rather than simple spread through a fully susceptible population.\nAcross both variants, transmission followed a repeated sequence: early increases within specific ethnic groups and villages, followed by delayed spread to other groups and locations. The recurrence of this pattern under different variants, and under conditions where prior infection was common, suggests that socially structured interaction pathways continued to shape transmission even in the presence of partial immunity.\nTaken together, these patterns indicate that COVID-19 transmission within the Reserve was shaped not only by when variants arrived, but by how social interactions were structured across ethnic and village boundaries. Rather than diffusing uniformly through the population, infections appear to have moved along socially patterned pathways, reflecting differences in contact frequency and mixing across groups. These dynamics motivate a closer examination of social structure as a key driver of disease spread within the Reserve.\n\n\nThe patterns described above suggest that social structure played a central role in shaping COVID-19 transmission within the Reserve. However, several key questions remain unresolved.\nPerhaps Jaguapiru’s proximity to the city drove higher infection rates there. If this were true, future pandemic preparedness plans might do well to focus resources on Jaguapiru residents who travel to the city due to economic necessity.\nMore generally, no matter how SARS-CoV-2 entered the Reserve, the structure of social interaction determines how it—and any other pathogen—spreads. What remains unclear is which way of defining social groups best represents the observed COVID-19 dynamics.\n\n\n\n\nTurner is leading an effort to formalize the hypotheses above into an epidemiological simulation and statistical model of COVID-19 transmission in the Reserve. The goal is to support public health planning for interventions such as incentivizing staying home, so that residents do not feel economically compelled to travel during outbreaks.\nWe begin by using data gathered by Albuquerque, Rezende, and Simionatto to fit the simulation model using statistical inference. In practice, this means identifying which model configurations generate simulated data that most closely match observed epidemiological patterns.\nThe model represents disease transmission through travel between the Reserve and the city of Dourados, followed by local spread shaped by interpersonal contact networks. A schematic overview of this structure is shown in Figure 4, where mobility and contact behaviors for different social groups are represented symbolically.\nTo determine which version of this model most faithfully represents COVID-19 in the Reserve, we infer the following:\n\nWhich social groupings (village, ethnicity, or village × ethnicity) produce models that best match the observed data?\nWas travel to the city a significant factor in importing different variants?\nDid reinfection play a significant role in the Zeta outbreak in the Reserve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Sketch of the mobility, social mixing, and interaction model for epidemiological dynamics. The parameters \\(c_{gg'}\\) indicate how frequently members of groups \\(g\\) and \\(g'\\) interact, grouped by village or ethnicity. \\(\\gamma_g\\) indicates how frequently each group travels to the city of Dourados.\n\n\n\nWhile understanding these dynamics is valuable in its own right, our primary aim is to use this knowledge to prepare effective social interventions before outbreaks escalate. Once a faithful model has been inferred, it can be put to work evaluating intervention strategies.\nWe use the model to infer which intervention strategies most effectively limit the number of cases under constrained resources. Different strategies correspond to different expenditures aimed at producing specific social changes. In the model, these changes are represented as adjustments to parameters governing mobility and social contact structure.\nFor example, public funds might be used to reduce travel to the city for one, several, or all social groups. Resources need not be allocated evenly. Given Jaguapiru’s proximity to the city, one might plausibly expect residents of Jaguapiru to travel more frequently than those in Bororó.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Sketches of model outcomes for planning public health interventions under limited resources. Groups benefit differently from quarantine-based interventions that target all groups equally, assuming zero reinfections (a). Targeted strategies can achieve more efficient and equitable outcomes, even when resource allocation itself is unequal (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency is essential: resources are limited, and we do not have the time or capacity to experiment freely in the real world.\nStatistical and simulation studies are valuable not only because they help us understand and predict real-world phenomena, but also because they highlight gaps in our knowledge. These gaps can point to where additional basic research—such as anthropological or ethnographic work—would be most valuable.\nWe see a unique opportunity to advance public health for Indigenous communities. Our long-term vision includes building a vibrant team of faculty and student researchers working on the ground in Dourados, documenting the Reserve and the public health efforts taking place there. This on-the-ground engagement is essential for grounding the development of effective computational tools for public health policy."

    "text": "Povos indígenas têm enfrentado, historicamente, riscos maiores associados a doenças epidêmicas e condições de saúde precárias — e a COVID-19 não foi exceção (Simionatto, Barbosa, e Marchioro 2020). Este projeto dá continuidade a uma colaboração iniciada a partir de um estudo de Albuquerque, Rezende e Simionatto, entre outros coautores, que acompanhou a disseminação de diferentes variantes do SARS-CoV-2 na Reserva Indígena de Dourados (Oliveira et al. 2023).\nNossa pesquisa corrente parte desse trabalho para investigar como a estrutura social influenciou a transmissão da COVID-19 dentro da Reserva. Por estrutura social, entendemos algo simples: quem interage com quem — e com que frequência. A geografia molda essas interações, já que tendemos a nos encontrar mais com pessoas que vivem perto de nós do que com aquelas que vivem longe. Além disso, agrupamentos culturais, étnicos e econômicos também influenciam esses padrões de contato.\nO objetivo central desta pesquisa é apoiar os moradores da Reserva Indígena de Dourados na preparação para futuras pandemias. Para isso, desenvolvemos ferramentas computacionais que permitem testar diferentes estratégias de resposta por meio de simulações, ajudando a antecipar escolhas difíceis antes que crises aconteçam.\nEmbora o trabalho esteja ancorado no contexto específico de Dourados, nossa intenção é que as ideias e métodos desenvolvidos aqui possam ser adaptados para fortalecer a prevenção e o controle de doenças em outras comunidades indígenas no Brasil e em outros países.\n\n\nA Reserva Indígena de Dourados está localizada no estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, no sudoeste do Brasil, ao lado da cidade de Dourados. Essa região é marcada por longas histórias de ocupação indígena, deslocamentos forçados e políticas estatais que reuniram diferentes povos indígenas em um mesmo território.\nAtualmente, a Reserva abriga cerca de 18.000 moradores, distribuídos em duas aldeias: Jaguapiru e Bororó. Jaguapiru é a maior das duas, com aproximadamente o dobro da população de Bororó. A população da Reserva inclui diferentes grupos indígenas, sendo os Guarani Kaiowá e os Terena os mais numerosos.\nA organização espacial da Reserva reflete sua proximidade com a cidade de Dourados, mas também mantém dinâmicas sociais próprias. O mapa abaixo mostra a localização da Reserva no Brasil, a relação entre as duas aldeias e a cidade, e os pontos utilizados para vigilância em saúde pública durante a pandemia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 1: Mapa da Reserva Indígena de Dourados e da cidade no contexto do Brasil. A Reserva e suas duas aldeias são mostradas em relação à cidade de Dourados e à sua localização no território brasileiro.\n\n\n\nO cotidiano na Reserva depende de uma combinação de instituições coletivas e infraestrutura local. O hospital da Reserva funciona como um ponto central de atendimento e inclui tanto uma capela cristã quanto uma estrutura cerimonial indígena ao ar livre, com fogueira ritual. Além disso, estações públicas de saúde distribuídas pelo território oferecem atendimento básico, e comércios locais atendem às necessidades do dia a dia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 2: Um passeio pela Reserva. Em frente ao hospital da Reserva (a), da esquerda para a direita: Dr. Paulo, juntamente com o padre da igreja católica próxima ao hospital; atrás do Dr. Paulo, Prof. Simionatto e Cais Simionelli. O hospital possui uma capela cristã ao lado de uma estrutura cerimonial indígena com fogueira ritual (b). Estações públicas de saúde estão distribuídas pelo interior da Reserva (c,d). Comércios independentes, como a Mercearia Conquista, fazem parte da vida cotidiana na Reserva (e).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbuquerque, Rezende, Simionatto e seus coautores desenvolveram um sistema de sequenciamento genômico e monitoramento epidemiológico para acompanhar a disseminação de variantes da COVID-19 na Reserva ao longo da pandemia. Como o momento de chegada de uma variante pode determinar quais respostas de saúde pública são mais eficazes, esse sistema permitiu confirmar que as variantes do SARS-CoV-2 chegaram à Reserva aproximadamente ao mesmo tempo em que chegaram a outras regiões do Brasil.\nNo entanto, os padrões observados de transmissão dentro da Reserva não foram uniformes. Em vários momentos, a disseminação da doença pareceu ser moldada de forma específica pela estrutura social, econômica e geográfica da Reserva.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 3: Série temporal da disseminação da COVID-19 na Reserva Indígena de Dourados.\nOs gráficos mostram a evolução dos casos por aldeia e por etnia, com eventos importantes destacados.\n\n\n\nEm julho de 2020, os primeiros casos de COVID-19 (variante B.1.1) foram detectados tanto em Jaguapiru quanto em Bororó. Nesse momento inicial, porém, os casos estavam restritos a indivíduos da etnia Guarani Kaiowá (Tempo 1 em Figura 3). Cerca de um mês depois, observou-se um aumento acentuado de casos, mas dessa vez quase exclusivamente entre residentes da etnia Terena — e apenas na aldeia Jaguapiru (Tempo 2 em Figura 3).\nA variante B.1.1 continuou a circular em Jaguapiru ao longo de agosto e setembro de 2020. Durante esse período, os casos passaram a incluir indivíduos tanto da etnia Terena quanto da etnia Guarani, indicando uma ampliação progressiva do alcance da transmissão dentro da aldeia.\nO surto final associado à variante B.1.1 ocorreu vários meses depois e esteve concentrado principalmente na aldeia Bororó (Tempo 3 em Figura 3). Diferentemente das fases anteriores, esse aumento foi impulsionado sobretudo por infecções entre indivíduos Guarani. Como a variante já havia circulado anteriormente em Jaguapiru entre diferentes grupos étnicos, esse padrão sugere que o aumento tardio em Bororó refletiu uma transmissão retardada ao longo de trajetórias de interação entre as duas aldeias, e não uma nova introdução independente da variante.\nUm padrão semelhante foi observado após a introdução da variante Zeta (P.2) no final de 2020. Os casos de Zeta aumentaram rapidamente em Jaguapiru durante o período das festas de fim de ano, especialmente entre indivíduos Guarani (Tempos 4–5 em Figura 3). Posteriormente, os casos passaram a crescer em Bororó, novamente concentrados entre residentes da etnia Terena (Tempo 6).\nComo muitos indivíduos já haviam sido infectados em ondas anteriores, esse aumento é consistente com uma combinação de novas infecções e reinfecções, e não apenas com a disseminação em uma população totalmente suscetível. Ainda assim, mesmo sob condições de imunidade parcial, a sequência de disseminação entre aldeias e grupos étnicos se manteve.\nConsideradas em conjunto, as ondas associadas às variantes B.1.1 e Zeta exibem um padrão recorrente: aumentos iniciais concentrados em grupos e localidades específicos, seguidos por uma disseminação posterior para outros grupos e aldeias. A repetição desse padrão sob variantes distintas — e em contextos com históricos diferentes de infecção — sugere que trajetórias de interação socialmente estruturadas continuaram a moldar a transmissão da COVID-19 na Reserva.\nEsses resultados indicam que a disseminação da COVID-19 na Reserva foi moldada não apenas pelo momento de chegada das variantes, mas pela forma como as interações sociais estavam organizadas entre aldeias e grupos étnicos. Em vez de se espalhar de maneira homogênea por toda a população, a doença parece ter seguido caminhos de contato social estruturados, refletindo diferenças na frequência e nos padrões de interação entre grupos. Esses achados motivam uma análise mais detalhada da estrutura social como um fator central na dinâmica de transmissão da doença na Reserva.\n\n\nOs padrões descritos acima indicam que a estrutura social teve um papel central na disseminação da COVID-19 na Reserva. Ainda assim, algumas questões importantes permanecem em aberto.\nUma possibilidade é que a proximidade da aldeia Jaguapiru com a cidade de Dourados tenha contribuído para taxas mais altas de infecção. Se isso for o caso, estratégias futuras de preparação para pandemias poderiam se beneficiar do foco em moradores que precisam se deslocar à cidade por motivos econômicos.\nDe forma mais ampla, independentemente de como um patógeno entra na Reserva, é a estrutura das interações sociais que determina como ele se espalha. O desafio é identificar quais formas de agrupar a população — por aldeia, por etnia, ou pela combinação dessas categorias — melhor representam a dinâmica observada da COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\nEste projeto busca formalizar essas ideias por meio de um modelo epidemiológico baseado em simulações e métodos estatísticos. O modelo representa a transmissão da doença a partir do deslocamento entre a Reserva e a cidade de Dourados, seguido da disseminação local moldada pelas redes de contato entre pessoas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 4: Esboço do modelo de mobilidade, mistura social e interação para a dinâmica epidemiológica. Os parâmetros \\(c_{gg'}\\) indicam a frequência de interação entre indivíduos de diferentes grupos \\(g\\) e \\(g'\\), definidos por aldeia ou etnia. O parâmetro \\(\\gamma_g\\) indica a frequência com que cada grupo se desloca até a cidade de Dourados.\n\n\n\nUtilizamos dados empíricos para ajustar o modelo e identificar quais configurações produzem resultados mais próximos do que foi observado na pandemia. Com isso, buscamos responder a perguntas como:\n\nquais agrupamentos sociais explicam melhor os dados observados;\nse o deslocamento até a cidade teve um papel importante na introdução de variantes;\nse reinfecções contribuíram para ondas posteriores da doença.\n\nO modelo também permite comparar diferentes estratégias de intervenção quando os recursos são limitados, representando mudanças sociais como alterações nos parâmetros que controlam mobilidade e contato social.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 5: Esboços de resultados do modelo para o planejamento de intervenções de saúde pública sob recursos limitados.\nOs grupos se beneficiam de maneira diferente de uma intervenção de quarentena que trata todos de forma igual, assumindo ausência de reinfecções (a).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prof. Simionatto tracked the spread of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. In ongoing work, she coordinates with hospital epidemiologists monitoring the origins and trajectories of new outbreaks to enable rapid response if the next COVID-19—or worse—emerges.\nDevelop computational decision-support tools for pandemic preparedness that explicitly model how social and economic factors influence disease spread.\n\n\n\nHow to Contribute\nWe welcome students from epidemiology, social sciences, political science, international relations, and related fields who are interested in contributing during the upcoming academic year.\nIf you have a research idea aligned with the project, are interested in working with us, or would like more information, please contact us: contato@projeto-dourados.org\n\nTimeline and Deliverables\n\nQ1 2026: Recruit UFGD student participants; introductions; begin projects.\nQ2 2026: First journal article drafts; release short documentary films (≤3-minute videos produced with mobile phones); publish initial translations and web content.\nQ3 2026: Revise and submit manuscripts; expand documentary and outreach materials; continue collaboration.\nQ4 2026: Synthesize project outputs; assess next phases of collaboration and funding.\n2027 and beyond: Sustain and expand the exchange program as opportunities allow.\n\n\n\n\nOur Team\n\nProject Leads\n\nSimone Simionatto — UFGD • ResearchGate\nMatheus de Carvalho Hernandez — UFGD • ResearchGate\nIzabela Maurício de Rezende — Stanford University • LinkedIn\nMatthew Turner — Stanford University • Website\n\n\n\nStudent Leaders and Contributors\n\nLaís Albuquerque de Oliveira — UFGD • LinkedIn\nCaio Gustavo Simonelli — UFGD • CNPq Online CV\n\n\n\n\nFoundational Support\nProjeto Dourados was made possible through the support of Mrs. Jill Freidenrich, whose funding provided fellowships and research support for Rezende and Turner at the Pandemic Preparedness Hub at Stanford Medicine. This support enabled Rezende to initiate collaboration with Simionatto, with Turner joining soon after. It quickly became clear that this project was a strong fit for advancing the practical use of social science in epidemiology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left: Laís Albuquerque, Caio Simonelli, Simone Simionatto, and Matt Turner at the Dourados Indigenous Reserve Hospital—the sign above us explains that the government health program SUS operates the hosopital to provide completely free health services to anyone who wants them, and that all visitors have the right to quality care."
