abstract = {Background: Despite significant progress in the areas of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, HIV continues to result in a substantial number of fatalities on a global scale each year. Gaining insights from epidemiological data can prove instrumental in the development of health promotion strategies, particularly within vulnerable populations, such as indigenous groups. Consequently, our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of HIV infection within the indigenous population residing in the second-largest region of Brazil. Additionally, we sought to explore the subtypes of HIV-1 and detect any drug-resistance mutations present within this population. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of HIV-1 infection and explore its associated characteristics within the indigenous population residing in the villages of Jaguapiru and Boror{\'{o}}, located in the Dourados area of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil. Blood samples were collected for rapid HIV screening, serological tests, nucleic acid amplification, and HIV subtyping. Additionally, the HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ T lymphocyte count of the people living with HIV (PLHIV) were assessed at the time of recruitment and 24 weeks later. Findings: Out of the 2190 invited individuals, 1927 (88%) were included in this study. The average age of the participants was 34.2 (±13.8) years, with a majority of 74% being female. Moreover, 68.44% of the participants identified themselves as belonging to the Guarani-Kaiowa ethnic group. HIV seroprevalence was 0.93% (18/1927), and 73.22% (1411/1927) were unaware of their serological status. The prevalence of HIV-1 was higher in single indigenous people [10/617 (1.62%)], who received government benefits [14/1021 (1.37%)], had less than five years of formal education [11/685 (1.61%)], had sexual intercourse with users of injectable drugs [2/21 (9.52%)], with history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [10/62 (16.2%)] and incarceration [3/62 (4.84%)]. Of 18 positive samples, 44.4% (8/18) were successfully amplified, and HIV-1 subtype C was prevalent. Furthermore, we identified HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in four patients, specifically from the classes of Protease Inhibitor, Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor, and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor. Notably, three of these patients exhibited a high viral load even after 24 weeks of undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Out of the 18 PLHIV, 66.66% (12/18) had a viral load below 1000 copies/mL, while 50% (9/18) had a CD4+ T lymphocytes count greater than 350 cells/mL after 24 weeks of treatment. Interpretation: Despite the concerted efforts to control HIV infection, the prevalence observed in the indigenous population under study surpassed that reported in other Brazilian indigenous groups. This disparity highlights the disproportionate impact of the disease on this particular group. The detection of drug-resistance mutations further emphasizes the critical need to expand diagnostic coverage, closely monitor treatment strategies, and maintain ongoing molecular surveillance. These measures are imperative for enhancing HIV management within this vulnerable population.
